Convolutional coder and decoder in C

I was in need of a convolutional coder and viterbi decoder in C, and,
well, I couldn't find anything suitable.  So unfortunately, I had to
write one.

To avoid others having the same problem, I've uploaded mine.

The API is descrdibed in the convcode.h file.

You can edit convcode.c, search for "Test code", enable the ifdef
above it, and compile it to enable the tests and a main() function to
do basic operations.  Docs are right there in the file.
